/**
 * Watches Grand Exchange offers and records the cost basis of every <b>buy</b> that fills.
 *
 * <p>A single buy is reported incrementally across many {@code GrandExchangeOfferChanged}
 * events. We diff each event against the last-seen state of that slot to extract only the
 * newly-filled quantity/spend. Because the previous state is persisted, offers that the
 * client re-broadcasts on login produce a zero delta and are not double-counted.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code offer.getSpent() / offer.getQuantitySold()} gives the true average price paid,
 * including partial fills at different prices, so we accumulate spend directly.</p>
